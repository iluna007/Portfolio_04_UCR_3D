# Project Overview

This project is a 3D portfolio developed using React and Vite. This project involves creating a web platform that showcases a detailed 3D point cloud survey of *Parque La Libertad* to enhance its impact on surrounding communities. It uses specialized tools like **Cloud Compare** for point cloud processing, **Rhinoceros** for 3D modelling, **Leaflet** for interactive geospatial navigation, **Speckle** for real-time collaboration, and **Ellipse Drive** for file management. The platform bridges technical data with local communities, encouraging participation and exploration, and leverages technologies like **React**, **JavaScript**, and **Flux** for dynamic interaction.

Technologies Used
React: Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite: Fast build tool and development server.
JavaScript (ES6+): Core programming language.
CSS: For styling components.
ESLint: Linting tool for maintaining code quality.
